 This extension holds functions and formatters the
 AmpelStartView uses.
 
 You could also integrate all this into AmpelStartView
 either directly or as an extension into AmpelStartView.swift
 but for readability this portion of the code lies here.
 
 The @State variables in AmpelStartView.swift are set to
 public because of this outsourcing. The different file
 makes the difference.
