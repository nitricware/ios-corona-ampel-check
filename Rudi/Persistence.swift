         1. define the AppGroup
         2. define the name of the database (<name>.xcdatamodeld)
         3. get the AppGroup's file container
         5. get the URL to the file container
         6. create a persistent container
         7. create a store description containing the url to the file container
         8. point the persistent container to the store in the AppGroups file container
         9. continue like without AppGroups
         
         Why all this? because you could decide to use the app's local persistent container and use
         the AppGroup's file container for something else. Of course,
         
         let container = NSPersistentContainer(name: "SomeName", location: "group.some.identifier")
         
         would be too much to ask...
