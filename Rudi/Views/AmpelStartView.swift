                 How is it done? It uses something called string interpolation.

                 The Date() is initialized with lastUpdate which is a Double right
                 from the @AppStorage - OR 0.0 if lastUpdate is nil (on the
                 first lauch i.e.) - that counts the seconds since 1970. It's set once
                 Rudi() fetched an update of the date in Rudi.swift.
